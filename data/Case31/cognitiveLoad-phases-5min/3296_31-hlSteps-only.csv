Anatomoses - Aortotomy,seems like the resident made a mistake and they adapted by starting the radial anastomosis earlier than planned, RIMA, radial) and 1 proximals (RIMA, but no radial because proximal radial is grafted onto LIMA). This means there won't be a side-biter, just the X clamp to do the 3 distals, this also affected the time at which they arrested the heart (wasn't until when indicated later)
